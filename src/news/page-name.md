For any enjoyer of the thriving indie scene, it’s become more and more common in recent years to see one particular name when playing especially great games—Fellow Traveller. The company, which took its current name in 2018, has done an excellent job of bringing incredible smaller games to players, whether it be by hosting the annual [LudoNarraCon](https://kotaku.com/steam-ludonarracon-2024-demos-afterlove-ep-1851469561) event on Steam or publishing games like 2022’s sci-fi masterpiece *[Citizen Sleeper](https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-rpg-game-pass-second-anniversary-1851449590)*. To celebrate the company’s wonderfully eclectic catalog, a Steam sale is slashing prices, and that means you can grab a wealth of amazing indies for a bargain.
